VeganMSP.com is a new project from [Matthew Jorgensen][blog]. Inspired
by [VeganMKE.com][veganmke], this site aims to be a complete-as-possible
guide to being vegan in and around the Minneapolis/St. Paul area. But
we're always welcome to suggestions! Find something wrong? Feel free to 
[open a ticket][tracker] on our tracker.
