title: Vegan Restaurants Around the Country

I do a fair bit of traveling. Usually I’m traveling to visit some of my
several vegan friends spread through the States. Since eating is so much
fun, I’ll try to make a point to eat at a new vegan restaurant each time
I visit. So far, I haven’t run out of new spots!

Since those places aren’t exactly related to Minneapolis/St. Paul, I’ve
compiled a list over on my [personal blog][blog].
